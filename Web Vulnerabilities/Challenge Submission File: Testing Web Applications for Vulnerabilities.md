Write two or three sentences outlining mitigation strategies for this vulnerability: 


```
Mitigation for directory traversal attack:
Limit the user input when calling for files from the web application
There should be input validation set up using a whitelist approach.
Web servers should run under a special service user account that only has access to that web folder.
```



### Web Application 2: _A Brute Force to Be Reckoned With_

Provide a screenshot confirming that you successfully completed this exploit:


```
Following was intercepted by Burp Suite under the proxy tab.
```

Write two or three sentences outlining mitigation strategies for this vulnerability: 


```
The ways to prevent or mitigate Brute Force Attacks:
Use Strong Passwords. 
Limit Login Attempts. 
Monitor IP addresses. 
Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
Use CAPTCHAs.
Use Unique Login URLs. 
Disable Root SSH Logins.
Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
