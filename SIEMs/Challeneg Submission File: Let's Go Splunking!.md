### Step 3: Drawing the (Base)line



1. When did the brute force attack occur?

![Screenshot 2023-08-07 141652](https://github.com/CyberCuriosity8586/ColumbiaUniversity-CyberSecurityBootCamp/assets/105434347/1edefb55-0dc1-49a6-aa37-b6e3629bc63e)

![Screenshot 2023-08-07 141725](https://github.com/CyberCuriosity8586/ColumbiaUniversity-CyberSecurityBootCamp/assets/105434347/69a40dc4-eb48-49d6-972a-cdfb9e8338eb)

```
Brute Force Attack happened on February the 20th 2020 at 9AM and lasted for 5 Hours up until 2PM. 
```


2. Determine a baseline of normal activity and a threshold that would alert if a brute force attack is occurring:

```
Based on the report, there are 5 to 35 normal failed logins per hour. The threshold would be set at 50 or more failed logins per hour with an email to be sent to SOC@vandalay.com when triggered.
```


3. Provide a screenshot showing that the alert has been created:
